# variables vs fields

* "define" records are held in variables
* invocations (tasks) don't see variables
* flon is about tasking taskers

* variables are for control-flow
* fields are for data(-flow)

* "ret" field, could be well...
* ret is more control flow, ret is a var
* args var
* rcv_invoke should copy "ret" field to "ret" var, then nuke "ret" field

* "args" fields or vars are easy to erase
