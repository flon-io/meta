# radial

"radial" is the language used by flon. At some point it could simply get renamed "flon". Not sure yet.

For now, I could say that radial/core instructions are what make up the "plain" language, while flon instructions (like "concurrence", "task") are what make up the "flon" language, where flon is the workflow engine.

## core instructions

### (parentheses)

TODO

### val

### set

### sequence

It sequences two sub-expressions, doesn't touch the `f.ret`.

```
  sequence
    task a
    task b
```

## flon instructions
